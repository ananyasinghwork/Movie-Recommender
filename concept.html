Recommender System is based on three categories- 
1. Content Based : based on the tags, we filter the reccomendations to the user
2. Collaborative Filtering : If two users are silimar in choices, the machine can reccomend the choices of one user to another. 
3. Demographic Based reccomender : The algorithm researches the region's choices to reccomend. For example- a show in india may not work in the US.
4. Hybrid Recommender System : Combining the two systems in a manner that suits an industry. It is the most sought after system.

We are going to implement Content-Based Recommender System.
